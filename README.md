## Natural Language Processing?

Arguably, Natural Language Processing is one of the most hyped and well-recognized branch of Artificial Intelligence discipline. It aims to equip machines to be able to understand the texts and contexts we use, which is a whole difference level of subject than basic machine learning discpline. 

This is because the meaning of contexts can be drastically changed only by a single word or by where a specific word positions in a sentence. It can be even more sophisticated by how puntuation marks can shift the meaning with that comprise same words.

Because of this, advanced technologies, such as `deep neural networks` are often used to make use of good understanding of human languages. Rather than relying on current timeline data, `Deep neural networks` enable computers to employ wider range of timeline data (e.g., past inputs) to make a good predictions.


## Natural Language Processing Applications

There are a number of applications of this cutting-edge technology, and the following are only a part of them.
* Machine translation (*Google Translate*)
* Voice recognition (*Alexa*, *Siri*, *Google Assistant*)
* and more ...


## Basic steps in Natural Langauge Processing

Regardless of applications, preprocessing step is needed for the purpose.

* Normalize (lowercase the capital letters)
* Tokenize (split words into separate tokens)
* Remove stopwords (punctuation marks are removed for core text processing)
* Stemming/Lemmatization (verbs are converted to root forms): This step is often omitted for applications such as `Machine Translation`

## My intentions to move forward

Why did I set my mind to move forward with this discipline?

I was motivated with a podcast episode of *NPR*'s `Platnet Money`, [BOTUS](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768370374/episode-763-botus). `BOTUS` means *Bot of the United States*, just like *POTUS*. That implies what this bot does. 

Namely, it analyzes President Trump's tweets and makes trading predictions only relying on them. This is clearly an application of Natural Language Processing, and I was intrigued by that and I hope to see myself implement something like that in the near future.
